# Jobcoin Application
Bitcoin is a very difficult protocol to work with, especially for a newcomer to cryptocurrencies, so this challenge is to create an interface for a new, much simpler online currency, the Jobcoin.  Jobcoins have “addresses” that are just arbitrary strings, and there’s no mining or transaction signing - anyone can create jobcoins out of thin air, or send them to an address.

You can access the Jobcoin management interface and APIs at https://jobcoin.gemini.com/possibly-earlobe
